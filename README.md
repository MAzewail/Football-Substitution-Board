# Football Substitution Board

Welcome to the Football Substitution Board GitHub repository! This project aims to recreate the functionality of a substitution board used in football matches using two seven-segment displays and six push buttons. The push buttons allow for changing numbers, resetting, adjusting time, and selecting different modes based on the duration of button presses.

## Project Overview

The Football Substitution Board project is designed to provide a digital substitute for the traditional substitution board used in football matches. It utilizes two seven-segment displays to show the player numbers, and six push buttons for various functionalities.

The system allows you to change player numbers, reset the display, adjust the time up and down, and select different modes based on the duration of button presses.

## Features

- Display player numbers on two seven-segment displays.
- Change player numbers using two dedicated push buttons.
- Reset the display to its initial state using one push button.
- Adjust the time up and down using one push button each.
- Select different modes based on the duration of button presses.

## Hardware Requirements

To set up and run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Two seven-segment displays
- Six push buttons
- Microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or PCB for circuit connections

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/football-substitution-board.git
   ```

1. Connect the hardware components (seven-segment displays and push buttons) to your microcontroller board based on the circuit diagram provided.

1. Upload the code to your microcontroller board using the Arduino IDE or your preferred development environment.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the hardware is properly connected to the microcontroller board.

1. Power on the system.

1. Use the dedicated push buttons for changing player numbers. Each press should increment the number by one.

1. To reset the display, press the reset push button.

1. Adjust the time up or down by pressing the corresponding push buttons.

1. Select different modes by varying the duration of button presses. Refer to the documentation or code comments for specific instructions on mode selection.

1. Enjoy using the Football Substitution Board for your football matches!
